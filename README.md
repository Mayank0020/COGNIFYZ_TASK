# Build a machine learning model to predict the aggregate rating of a restaurant based on other features.

## Overview

This repository contains a Python notebook that uses Linear Regression Model and Decision Tree Regressor Model to predict the aggregate rating of a retaurant.

## Contents

The repository contains the following file:-

1.  task_1.ipynb : A jupyter notebook including the code of the Linear Regression Model and Decision Tree Regressor Model
2.  requirements.txt : A text file containing the libraries used to create this project
3.  Dataset .csv : CSV file cotaining the aggregate rating and features of multiple restaurants

## Getting Started :-

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required python libraries from requirments.txt
3. Open the task_1.ipynb on your system and run the file

## Results :-

The performance of this model is calculated using Mean Squared Eror (MSE), R Squared and Accuracy score

## Contributing :-

Contributions are welcome! If you have any ideas, suggestions, or improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Acknoledgment :-

- The dataset was obtained from cognifyz technology company
- This project was inspired by various online tutorials and courses on machine learning and data science.
